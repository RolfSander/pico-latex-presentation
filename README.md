# pico-latex-presentation
This is a repository to collect ideas for a Latex document to produce a PICO presentation for the EGU conference.

There is a pdf as preview to see the result. The document will not compile because most figures are missing, so edit the source or add you own image.

Initial version is now in branch v1. It is not recommended to use the old files. The new master branch is much easier to use (automatic generation of navigation bar)
